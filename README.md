# GProTorch: 
Gaussian Process Library for Molecules, Proteins and General Chemistry in PyTorch


## Data Loaders

Data loaders in GProTorch are based on an internal representation 
(SMILES strings for molecular property prediction, 
paths to .pdb and .sdf files for protein-ligand binding affinity prediction).
